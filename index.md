# Favorite CPSC 120L Labs



    *Lab 6, Part 1
I found this lab to be really enjoyable as it was pretty easy to understand and the task was pretty funny as it was asking us to code sandwich orders. Also enjoyed this lab because me and my partner were able to learn from each other and correct each others errors.


    *Lab 7, Part 1 
This lab was pretty challenging at first as we had to understand military time before we could set the time for the parking spot. Once we figured out Military time this lab became easier to understand but was still a challenge as it still required critical thinking. 


    *Lab 4, part 1
I learned a lot from this lab especially from my partner because he was well informed and this lab was able to give me a better understanding of code and make me perform much better in future labs. This lab was pretty easy as we were just converting measurements.
